## 9:00 - 9:20

Clear R!! Make sure you have the data downloaded!! 

# intro talk

### intro obejctives
* compare tradeoffs of R vs openrefine vs sql
* name what each pane does and why/how its useful
* execute r code from script

First half of the morning, nuts and bolts, how to work within Rstudio, 
How R thinks about data.  Second half, using tools to write code that 
does some analysis and manipulation.  May be slow for some, want to have 
a good foundation.  

Open R, have people create a project (explain that we'll discuss in a min)

Orientation of Rstudio.  Primary purpose is to be a place ot write and run 
R code; also has extra features, shortcuts.  Project as a way to set wd.

This is our workbench, need to understand what each piece does.
Console (use seq(), getwd())
Want to save our commands in a more permanent way, so going to put them in script
Open script, save it, paste commands, show how to evaluate them, talk about comments. 
Top right -- a record, history and environment
Bottom right, other info (files, help, plots)
Workflow today is going to be adding text in the script, executing it.  Bear with 
the screen management side of things.  

Rsudio as workbench, projects are organizing feature. 
Writing R code as script so we have a record
- comments
- clear code
